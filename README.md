## 🎯 Objective
To identify how the NSPCC can measure *spontaneous awareness growth* and define the key KPIs that best evaluate campaign impact on trust and donation likelihood.

---

## 🧩 Methods
- **Framework:** CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining)
- **Approach:** Mixed-methods combining:
  - Diagnostic **text analysis** of open-ended survey responses  
  - Predictive **logistic regression** for donation likelihood  
  - Prescriptive **KPI framework** for campaign strategy  
- **Tools:** Excel · Python (pandas · statsmodels) · Tableau

---

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Value congruence** (moral alignment) and **brand recognition** were the strongest predictors of donations.  
- Older & married individuals showed the highest giving propensity.  
- Non-donors cited *low awareness* and *financial constraints* as main barriers.  
- Proposed **Trust-Weighted Spontaneous Awareness Score** redefines campaign success from reach to *trust-weighted quality.*

---

## 🧠 Outcomes
- Five ethical brand strategies  
- Six multidimensional KPIs  
- Framework enables NSPCC to target a 4-point awareness increase by 2027
