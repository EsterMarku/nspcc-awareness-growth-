# Methodology and Model Design

## Framework: CRISP-DM
This project followed the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, ensuring a structured and repeatable approach to research and analytics.

1. **Business Understanding**  
   Defined the core question: *How can the NSPCC measure spontaneous awareness growth and identify the KPIs that best reflect trust and donation likelihood?*  
   This step included stakeholder discussions and reviewing NSPCC’s campaign goals.

2. **Data Understanding**  
   Analysed mixed data sources combining quantitative survey data and qualitative open-ended responses.  
   Explored key variables:
   - Awareness level (spontaneous vs. prompted)
   - Donation history and intent
   - Trust perception
   - Moral value alignment with NSPCC’s mission  
   Performed initial descriptive statistics and outlier detection in Excel and Python.

3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned categorical and ordinal responses.  
   - Encoded variables such as donation intent (0 = No, 1 = Yes).  
   - Created synthetic anonymised dataset for demonstration purposes.  
   - Standardised scales for trust, recognition, and alignment metrics.

4. **Modeling**
   Applied a two-part approach:
   - **Diagnostic Analysis:** Correlation and cross-tabulation to identify early trends between awareness and giving behaviour.  
   - **Predictive Modeling:**  
     Used **Logistic Regression** to estimate the probability of donation as a function of:
       - Trust score  
       - Spontaneous awareness  
       - Moral alignment index  
       - Demographics (age, marital status, income bracket)
   The model was selected for interpretability and transparency, aligning with ethical requirements in charity research.

   **Logistic Regression Formula:**  
   \[
   P(\text{Donation}=1) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 A + \beta_3 M + \beta_4 D)}}
   \]  
   where *T* = trust, *A* = awareness, *M* = moral alignment, *D* = demographic variables.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Assessed predictive performance using accuracy and AUC metrics.  
   - Validated findings with qualitative insights (open-text themes on trust, motivation, and barriers).  
   - Triangulated both data sources to derive multi-dimensional KPIs.

6. **Deployment (Insights & Recommendations)**  
   Delivered a strategic framework for measuring campaign effectiveness, proposing six KPI dimensions:
   - Trust-Weighted Awareness  
   - Value Congruence Index  
   - Emotional Resonance Score  
   - Brand Recall Rate  
   - Donation Propensity Index  
   - Engagement Conversion Ratio

   Visualised results using **Tableau** dashboards to support executive decision-making and communication of key metrics.

## Tools Used
- **Excel** – data cleaning, pivot summaries  
- **Python** – analysis (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib)  
- **Tableau** – dashboarding and storytelling  
- **Word/PDF** – report creation and visual summary  

---

## Ethical Considerations
- All personal identifiers were removed prior to analysis.  
- The dataset provided in this repository is synthetic and for demonstration only.  
- The project adhered to the University of Birmingham’s ethical research guidelines for human data.

---

## Outcome
The model and framework allow the NSPCC to evaluate not only *how many* people know the brand, but *how deeply* that awareness connects to trust and action—providing a data-driven foundation for future campaign design.
